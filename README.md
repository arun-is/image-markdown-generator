# image-markdown-generator

Arun Venkatesan uses this tool at arun.is.

It takes a folder full of images, reads their exif data and outputs a code that can be copied into a markdown editor. The code includes embedding the image and also a caption listing out the camera settings used.

Example of the code below:

![](L1040870.jpg) <span class="f5 db tr o-40 nb3">Leica Q · f/14 · 1/125 · ISO
100</span>
